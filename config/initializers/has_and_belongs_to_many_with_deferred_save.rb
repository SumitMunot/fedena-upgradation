      # Then add a validation method that adds an error if there is something wrong with the (unsaved) collection. This will prevent it from being saved if there are any errors.
      #
      # Example:
      #
      #  def validate
      #    if people.size > maximum_occupancy
      #      errors.add :people, "There are too many people in this room"
